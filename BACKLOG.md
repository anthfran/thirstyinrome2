## Features

### FEAT-005: Localize UI for top 25 tourist countries to Italy
Add `.xcstrings` localization for the top 25 countries by inbound Italian tourism. All visible strings (button labels, toast messages, alert text, map callouts) are externalized and translated.

**Locales:** English, Italian, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Dutch, Polish, Russian, Korean, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Czech, Hungarian, Romanian, Finnish, Arabic, Turkish, Greek, Croatian, Slovak.

**AC:**
- All user-visible strings live in a Strings Catalog (`Localizable.xcstrings`), not hardcoded in Swift files
- All 25 locales have translations (machine translation acceptable for initial pass)
- Device locale automatically selects the correct language; English is the fallback
- Build succeeds and all existing tests pass

### FEAT-002: Navigate to fountain via Maps
Tapping a fountain marker shows an action sheet or callout with options to open directions in Apple Maps or Google Maps (falling back to Apple Maps if Google Maps is not installed).

## Completed

### ~~REFACTOR-004: ContentView is doing too much~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-17
**Branch:** `main`
**AC met:**
- `LocationButtonState` enum lives in `LocationButton.swift`, not `ContentView.swift`
- `ContentView` contains no GPS-specific state vars, computed props, or methods
- GPS button, toast, and settings alert behavior unchanged (toast now appears above GPS button in bottom-trailing area)
- Build succeeds and all existing tests pass

### ~~REFACTOR-002: clusters() and singlePlaces() are test-only wrappers~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-17
**Branch:** `refactor/refactor-002-remove-test-wrappers`
**AC met:**
- `clusters()` and `singlePlaces()` removed from `PlaceViewModel`
- 5 tests updated to call `clusteringResult()` once per test, binding `result.clusters` / `result.singles`
- No `clusters(` or `singlePlaces(` remain outside docs/history
- All tests pass

### ~~REFACTOR-001: Magic numbers not shared between files~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-17
**Branch:** `refactor/refactor-001-named-constants`
**AC met:**
- `clusteringThreshold` and `zoomedInSpan` defined as `private static let` on `ContentView`
- No bare `0.027` or `0.01` literals remain outside the constant definitions
- Build succeeds

### ~~BUG-003: GPS wait toast timer leaks on rapid taps~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-17
**Branch:** `bug/bug-003-toast-timer-leak`
**AC met:**
- No `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` in `handleLocationButtonTap`
- `toastDismissTask` is a `@State Task<Void, Never>?` on `ContentView`
- Rapid taps result in a single dismiss 2 seconds after the last tap
- All existing tests pass

### ~~FEAT-001: Marker clustering when zoomed out~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-16
**Branch:** `feat/feat-001-marker-clustering`
**AC met:**
- Markers group into blue circle cluster annotations (count label) when map span > 0.027° (~3km)
- Single-marker grid cells render as individual `Marker`s even when zoomed out
- Tapping a cluster zooms camera to the cluster's bounding region
- All individual markers visible when zoomed in past 0.027°

### ~~FEAT-003: Re-center on Rome button~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-16
**Branch:** `feat/feat-003-recenter-rome`
**AC met:**
- White capsule button (building.columns SF Symbol + "Rome" label) overlaid bottom-left on the map
- Tapping instantly resets camera to Rome center (41.899159, 12.473065), span 0.027°
- Button respects safe area (stays above home indicator)

### ~~FEAT-004: Re-center on GPS button~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-16
**Branch:** `feat/feat-004-recenter-gps`
**AC met:**
- Filled capsule button (location.fill SF Symbol + "My Location" label) overlaid bottom-right on the map
- Blue when authorized + GPS fix available — tapping re-centers camera on user position
- Red (location.slash.fill) when authorized but no fix — tapping shows "Waiting for GPS signal…" toast
- Grey when unauthorized — tapping requests permission if not determined, or shows Settings alert if denied
- Settings alert includes "Open Settings" deep link
- Button state updates automatically as authorization and GPS fix change
- distanceFilter set to 10m to avoid redundant updates

### ~~BUG-001: Cluster annotations recreated on every render~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-16
**Branch:** `bug/bug-001-refactor-003-stable-ids`
**AC met:**
- `Place.id` decoded from `Places.json` — stable across all decodes and app installs, suitable for cross-device reporting
- `Cluster.id` derived from sorted member place IDs — same fountains always produce the same ID
- No `UUID()` allocated at runtime for `Place` or `Cluster`

### ~~REFACTOR-003: Place.id is non-stable across decodes~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-16
**Branch:** `bug/bug-001-refactor-003-stable-ids`
**AC met:**
- `Place.id` is a stable `String` decoded from `Places.json`, not a runtime `UUID()`
- `CodingKeys` removed — all `Place` properties map directly to JSON keys

### ~~BUG-002: authorizationStatus initializes to .notDetermined regardless of actual status~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-16
**Branch:** `bug/bug-002-authorization-status-init`
**AC met:**
- `authorizationStatus` reflects the real `CLLocationManager` status immediately after `PlaceViewModel.init()` returns
- No intermediate `.notDetermined` observable on second launch
- Regression test `testAuthorizationStatusMatchesSystemAfterInit` documents the invariant

### ~~REFACTOR-005: Remove dead test scaffolding~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-16
**Branch:** `refactor/refactor-005-remove-dead-tests`
**AC met:**
- `thirstyinromeTests/thirstyinromeTests.swift` deleted
- `thirstyinromeUITests/thirstyinromeUITests.swift` deleted
- `thirstyinromeUITests/thirstyinromeUITestsLaunchTests.swift` deleted
- CLAUDE.md "run all tests" command includes `-skip-testing:thirstyinromeUITests`
- All unit tests in `PlaceTests.swift` pass

### ~~FEAT-006: Migrate app identity from legacy repo~~
✓ Done 2026-04-18 | Branch: feat/feat-006-migrate-app-identity | AC met
Transfer the App Store app identity from `/Users/anthony/github/thirstyinrome-legacy/ThirstyInRome` into this repo so the new codebase can replace the existing App Store listing — including Bundle ID, app icon, entitlements, and any relevant build settings.

**AC:**
- Bundle ID matches the existing App Store listing's Bundle ID
- App icon asset catalog migrated and renders correctly at all required sizes
- All entitlements and capabilities from the legacy target are replicated in this project
- Build succeeds and app can be archived and submitted to App Store Connect without creating a new listing
- Legacy-specific dead code or assets not needed by this codebase are excluded

### ~~BUG-004: Cluster marker intercepts pinch-to-zoom gesture~~ ✓ Done 2026-04-18
**Branch:** `fix/bug-004-cluster-pinch-gesture`
**AC met:**
- Pinch-to-zoom succeeds regardless of whether a finger starts on a cluster annotation
- Single-finger tap on a cluster still zooms the camera to the cluster's bounding region
- No regression on individual fountain marker tap behavior
